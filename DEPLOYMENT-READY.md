# 🚀 Deployment Ready - Node.js Version Fix Complete

**Status:** ✅ READY TO DEPLOY  
**Date:** October 29, 2025

## What Was Fixed

### Critical Issue: Node.js Version Mismatch
- **Before:** GitHub Actions built with Node 22, Azure ran with Node 20
- **After:** Both use Node 20-lts consistently

### Changes Applied

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `.github/workflows/azure-webapp.yml` | Node 22 → Node 20 |
| `server/package.json` | Node >=18.0.0 → Node >=20.0.0 |

## Deployment Instructions

### ✅ Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

**Simply merge this PR to `main` branch:**
```bash
# GitHub Actions will automatically:
1. Build with Node 20
2. Run tests
3. Deploy to Azure App Service
4. Azure will run with Node 20-lts
```

### ⏱️ Expected Timeline
- Build & Deploy: ~5-10 minutes
- Application available after deployment completes

---

## Verification Steps

After deployment, verify the application is working:

1. **Check Health Endpoint:**
   ```bash
   curl https://your-app.azurewebsites.net/healthz
   ```
   
   Expected response:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "healthy",
     "service": "Odin's Eye Restaurant Intelligence"
   }
   ```

2. **View Application Logs:**
   ```bash
   az webapp log tail --name your-app-name --resource-group your-resource-group
   ```

3. **Check Application Insights:**
   - Go to Azure Portal
   - Navigate to your App Service
   - Click "Application Insights"
   - View logs and performance metrics

## About Those Database Names

**Q: What about "muddy sky" and "odins vallhalla"?**

**A:** These databases **don't exist** in your codebase.

**Your actual database:**
- Type: Azure Cosmos DB (NoSQL)
- Database: RestaurantIntelligence
- Containers: restaurants, pldata, inventory, subscriptions

**If you need those Neon databases:**
1. They must be created separately in your Neon account
2. Connection strings need to be added to Azure App Service
3. Code changes required to integrate them

## No Further Action Required

✅ Code changes complete  
✅ Documentation updated  
✅ Security scan passed  
✅ Syntax validated  
✅ Ready for deployment

**Next Step:** Merge this PR and let GitHub Actions deploy automatically.
