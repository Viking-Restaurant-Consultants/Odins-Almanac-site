# Quick Answer: How to Fix Azure Application Errors

## What Was Wrong?

Your GitHub Actions was building with **Node.js 22**, but Azure was trying to run it with **Node.js 20**. This mismatch caused application errors.

## What Was Fixed?

✅ Changed GitHub Actions to use Node.js **20** (matches Azure)  
✅ Updated server package.json to require Node.js **>=20.0.0**  
✅ All configurations now use Node.js 20 consistently

## About Those Database Names

**"muddy sky"** and **"odins vallhalla"** - These databases **don't exist** in your code.

Your application actually uses:
- **Azure Cosmos DB** database named "RestaurantIntelligence"
- Not Neon/PostgreSQL databases

## What to Do Next

1. **Merge this pull request** to the main branch
2. **GitHub Actions will automatically deploy** the fixed code to Azure
3. **Your application should now work** without Node version errors

## Still Having Issues?

If you still see errors after deployment:

1. Check Azure App Service logs
2. Verify your Cosmos DB connection string is set
3. Make sure all environment variables are configured in Azure

## Need Those Neon Databases?

If you actually need "muddy sky" or "odins vallhalla" databases:
1. Create them in your Neon account first
2. Get the connection strings
3. Let me know and I can help integrate them

---

**Bottom Line:** The Node.js version mismatch is now fixed. Deploy this to Azure and your application should work properly.
