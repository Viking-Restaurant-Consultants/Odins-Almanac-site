# Restaurant Management System

## Overview

This is a comprehensive restaurant management system with **patentable AI-powered innovations** for inventory optimization, waste reduction, and loss prevention. The system is designed for **dual-platform deployment**:

1. **Web Application (This Replit Project)**: Browser-based SaaS platform for desktop and tablet use
2. **Mobile Application (VibCode)**: React Native app for iOS and Android App Store distribution

Both platforms share the same **proprietary algorithms and patentable innovations** to ensure comprehensive patent coverage across web and mobile implementations.

## Patent Strategy

This system contains **six major patentable innovations** that are implemented consistently across both web and mobile platforms:

### 1. PIOE - Predictive Inventory Optimization Engine
Multi-dimensional demand prediction combining historical sales, weather data, local events, and cross-item correlations with machine learning.

### 2. SPLOS - Smart Par Level Optimization System  
Automated par level adjustment with confidence-based automation, allowing AI to implement high-confidence recommendations automatically while requiring human approval for uncertain changes.

### 3. Advanced Multi-POS Synchronization Engine
Distributed conflict resolution algorithm for synchronizing inventory across multiple heterogeneous POS systems with intelligent business logic prioritization.

### 4. IWPPS - Intelligent Waste Prediction and Prevention System
Comprehensive waste prediction combining spoilage modeling, demand forecasting, dynamic FIFO rotation, supplier quality correlation, and menu engineering recommendations.

### 5. IVALPS - Inventory Variance Analysis and Loss Prevention System
Real-time theoretical inventory calculation with statistical variance analysis, machine learning loss pattern recognition, theft detection, and automated reporting.

### 6. ISCE - Inventory-Sales Coupling Engine
Real-time waste detection through POS-inventory coupling, automatic anomaly detection, and pattern-based waste trend analysis.

The dual-platform approach ensures maximum market coverage and stronger patent protection by demonstrating the innovations work across different technology stacks.
