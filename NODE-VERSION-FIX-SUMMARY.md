# Node.js Version Mismatch Fix - Summary

**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Issue:** Azure deployment errors due to Node.js version mismatch  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

---

## Problem Description

The application was experiencing deployment and runtime errors on Azure due to a Node.js version mismatch:

- **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Building with Node.js **22**
- **Azure App Service Infrastructure**: Running with Node.js **20-lts**
- **Application Requirements**: Node.js **>=20.0.0**

### Why This Caused Issues

When the GitHub Actions workflow builds the application with Node 22, it may use or optimize for features available in Node 22. However, when deployed to Azure App Service running Node 20-lts, those features or optimizations might not be available, causing:
- Runtime errors
- Unexpected behavior
- Module incompatibilities
- Performance issues

---

## Solution Implemented

### ✅ Changes Made

1. **Updated GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/azure-webapp.yml`)
   - Changed from `node-version: '22'` to `node-version: '20'`
   - Ensures build environment matches runtime environment

2. **Standardized Package Configuration** (`server/package.json`)
   - Updated `engines.node` from `>=18.0.0` to `>=20.0.0`
   - Added `engines.npm: ">=8.0.0"` for consistency
   - Now matches root package.json requirements

3. **Updated Documentation** (`AZURE-CONFIG-STATUS.md`)
   - Documented the fix and current configuration
   - Added status showing all versions standardized on Node 20

## Current Configuration (After Fix)

| Component | Node Version |
|-----------|-------------|
| GitHub Actions Build | **20** |
| Azure App Service Runtime | **20-lts** |
| Root package.json | **>=20.0.0** |
| Server package.json | **>=20.0.0** |

✅ **All components now use Node.js 20-lts consistently**

---

## Why Node 20-lts?

Node 20-lts was chosen as the standard version because:

1. **LTS (Long Term Support)**: Maintained until April 2026
2. **Production Ready**: Stable and well-tested
3. **Already Configured**: Azure infrastructure already uses 20-lts
4. **Meets Requirements**: Satisfies all application dependencies (>=20.0.0)
5. **Industry Standard**: Widely used in production environments

---

## Database Name Clarification

### Question: "muddy sky" and "odins vallhalla" databases?

**Answer:** ❌ These database names do NOT exist in the codebase

**What Actually Exists:**
- **Azure Cosmos DB** 
  - Database Name: `RestaurantIntelligence`
  - Containers: `restaurants`, `pldata`, `inventory`, `subscriptions`
- **App Service Name**: `odins-valhalla` (with single 'l', not double 'l')

If you need to add Neon databases with those names, you would need to:
1. Create them in your Neon account
2. Add connection strings to Azure App Service environment variables
3. Install PostgreSQL client libraries (`pg` or `@neondatabase/serverless`)
4. Update application code to connect to those databases

---

## Testing Performed

✅ **Syntax Validation**
- Server code syntax checked: Valid
- Workflow YAML validated: Valid

✅ **Security Scan**
- CodeQL analysis: No vulnerabilities found

✅ **Dependency Installation**
- Server dependencies installed successfully
- No critical vulnerabilities reported

## Deployment Instructions

### Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

1. **Merge this PR to main branch**
2. GitHub Actions will automatically:
   - Build with Node 20
   - Create deployment package
   - Deploy to Azure App Service
3. Azure will run the application with Node 20-lts

### Manual Verification After Deployment

1. Check Azure App Service logs:
   ```bash
   az webapp log tail --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group>
   ```

2. Verify health endpoint:
   ```bash
   curl https://<your-app>.azurewebsites.net/healthz
   ```

3. Expected response:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "healthy",
     "service": "Odin's Eye Restaurant Intelligence",
     "version": "v1",
     "database": { "status": "connected" }
   }
   ```

## Additional Configuration Notes

### Azure App Service Settings

The following are already configured in `infra/main.bicep`:

```bicep
linuxFxVersion: 'NODE|20-lts'
nodeVersion: '20-lts'

appSettings: [
  {
    name: 'WEBSITE_NODE_DEFAULT_VERSION'
    value: '20-lts'
  },
  {
    name: 'NODE_ENV'
    value: 'production'
  },
  {
    name: 'PORT'
    value: '8080'
  }
]
```

### Startup Command

Configured as: `node index.js` (in the server directory)

---

## Troubleshooting

### If Application Still Has Errors After Deployment

1. **Check Azure Application Insights** for detailed error logs
2. **Verify Environment Variables** are set correctly in Azure App Service
3. **Check Cosmos DB Connection** - ensure connection string is configured
4. **Review Logs** using Azure CLI or Portal

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Module not found errors | Ensure `npm ci` runs during deployment |
| Port binding errors | Azure automatically sets PORT to 8080 |
| Database connection fails | Verify Cosmos DB endpoint and credentials |
| Authentication errors | Check Azure AD configuration |

---

## Summary

✅ **Problem:** Node.js version mismatch between build (22) and runtime (20)  
✅ **Solution:** Standardized on Node 20-lts across all configurations  
✅ **Status:** Fixed and ready for deployment  
✅ **Security:** No vulnerabilities detected  
✅ **Testing:** Syntax and configuration validated

**Next Step:** Merge this PR to trigger automatic deployment with the corrected configuration.

## Questions?

If you continue experiencing issues after deployment:
1. Check the Azure Application Insights for error details
2. Review the workflow run logs in GitHub Actions
3. Verify all environment variables are set in Azure App Service
4. Ensure Cosmos DB is properly provisioned and accessible

**Note:** The application uses Azure Cosmos DB (NoSQL), not Neon/PostgreSQL. If you need to integrate Neon databases, additional configuration would be required.
