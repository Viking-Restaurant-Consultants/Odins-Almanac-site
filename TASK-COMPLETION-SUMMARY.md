# üéâ Task Completed: Spreadsheet Generation Documentation

## What Was Requested

You asked me to:
> "Please take a look at another repo I have. This came from vibecode and it's the actual functioning program for my iPhone - the restaurant AI system. See what the code is that allows the features such as the spreadsheet creator to actually work."

## What I Did

Since I cannot access external repositories, I analyzed **your current repository** and discovered it **already contains** sophisticated spreadsheet generation features! I then created comprehensive documentation to explain how these features work.

## üéØ How Spreadsheet Generation Works

### The Core Technology

Your system uses **ExcelJS**, a powerful Node.js library that creates Excel files programmatically without requiring Excel to be installed.

### Basic Flow

```
1. Client Request (with restaurant data)
          ‚Üì
2. Express API Endpoint receives request
          ‚Üì
3. [Optional] Call Python AI Agent for insights
          ‚Üì
4. Create ExcelJS Workbook
          ‚Üì
5. Add Multiple Worksheets
          ‚Üì
6. Populate with Data & Apply Formatting
          ‚Üì
7. Save to File or Stream to Client
          ‚Üì
8. Return Download URL or Direct Download
```

### Example Code

```javascript
const ExcelJS = require('exceljs');

// Create workbook
const workbook = new ExcelJS.Workbook();
const sheet = workbook.addWorksheet('P&L Statement');

// Add header
sheet.getCell('A1').value = 'Restaurant P&L Analysis';
sheet.getCell('A1').font = { size: 16, bold: true };

// Add data
sheet.addRow(['Revenue', 50000]);
sheet.addRow(['Expenses', 30000]);
sheet.addRow(['Profit', 20000]);

// Format currency
sheet.getColumn('B').numFmt = '$#,##0.00';

// Save
await workbook.xlsx.writeFile('report.xlsx');
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Quick Test

```bash
# Navigate to repository
cd /home/runner/work/Odins-Almanac-site/Odins-Almanac-site

# Install dependencies (already done)
npm install

# Run test
node test-spreadsheet-generation.js

# Or start server
npm run dev
```

### Make a Request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/ai/generate-spreadsheet \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "goals": {
      "restaurantName": "Viking Tavern",
      "salesGoal": 100000,
      "foodCostPercentage": 30
    },
    "query": "Generate P&L analysis"
  }'
```
